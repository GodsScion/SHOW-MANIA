<section>
    <h2>New Section 1</h2>
    <p>This is the first new section. It includes some information about a particular topic.</p>
    <p>You can add as many paragraphs as you need to fully cover the topic. Be sure to include all relevant details and examples to help readers understand the material.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>New Section 2</h2>
    <p>This is the second new section. It covers a different topic than the first section.</p>
    <p>Use headings to organize your content and make it easier for readers to follow along. Each section should focus on a single topic or idea.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>New Section 3</h2>
    <p>This is the third new section. It builds on the information presented in the previous sections.</p>
    <p>Be sure to provide clear explanations and examples to help readers understand complex concepts. Use diagrams and other visual aids to make your content more engaging and easier to follow.</p>

    <h2>AI Info</h2>
    <p>The concept of AI was first introduced in 1950 by the British mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing.</p>
    <p>In his seminal paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," Turing proposed a test to determine whether a machine could exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. </p>
    <p>This test, known as the Turing Test, has become a benchmark for measuring the progress of AI research. In the following decades, AI research made significant strides in areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning. </p>
    <p>However, progress was slow and uneven, and AI research experienced several setbacks and periods of decline. It wasn't until the 1980s, with the advent of expert systems and machine learning algorithms, that AI research began to gain momentum again. </p>
    <p>Today, AI has become a ubiquitous technology that is transforming industries and society. From self-driving cars to voice assistants, AI is making our lives easier, safer, and more convenient. However, the field of AI is still in its infancy, and there are many challenges and opportunities ahead. </p>
    <p>As AI continues to evolve, it will be up to researchers, policymakers, and society as a whole to ensure that this technology is used ethically and responsibly.</p>
